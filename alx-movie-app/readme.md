## API Overview

The **MoviesDatabase API** is a RESTful API that provides detailed information about movies, TV shows, and actors.

The API is hosted on RapidAPI and supports pagination, filtering, and sorting to make data retrieval efficient.

Key features include:

- Search movies, TV shows, and people by keyword.
- Retrieve details for specific movies or TV shows using unique IDs.
- Access cast, crew, and production details.
- Explore similar or related titles.
- Paginated responses for large datasets.

Use filters and query parameters to minimize unnecessary data transfer.

Respect the rate limits to avoid temporary bans.

Secure your API key â€” never expose it in public repositories.
